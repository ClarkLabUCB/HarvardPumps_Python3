## About the Project

These programs provide a GUI to run Harvard Milliliter OEM Syringe Pumps with 1 mL, 3 mL, 5 mL, 10, 20, or 30 mL Becton Dickinson syringes in Python. The interface includes the ability to set both syringe size and forward/reverse flow, pump labeling, pump priming, and the ability to easily stop or update flow settings.  

This code was originally written in the Abate Lab at UC San Francisco by Phil Romero. It was adapted by Iain Clark and Rohan Thakur for use with Harvard eom pumps and modified further for use with Python 3 (using example code from John Halliburton) into its present form by Kevin Joslin and Sakshi Shah in the Clark lab at UC Berkeley. We hope you find it useful. 

### Built With

* [Python](https://www.python.org/)
* [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)

## Getting Started

This software has only been tested on PC desktops running Windows 10. Any adaptations to other operating systems will need to be done by the user. The following workflow will assume you have a PC desktop running Windows 10. We are currently working on creating a standalone Windows application for the pump programs, but we can only demonstrate the use of running the GUI through Python code at this time.

### Prerequisites

* [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/)

We recommend that you use Anaconda to install the latest version of Python 3 as well for installing required packages; it will also come with packages to run PyQt interfaces with no setup. Detailed instructions for installing Anaconda on windows can be found [here](https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/windows/). In most cases you will be installing the 64-Bit Graphical Installer. We recommend that you do **not** check "Add Anaconda3 to my PATH environmental variable" at this time. Once you have Anaconda downloaded and installed you can proceed to the installation of the programs.

### Installation

1. Installing [PyQt5](https://pypi.org/project/PyQt5/)
   - **Note**: If you installed Anaconda then PyQt should already be within your usable packages and there is no need to install PyQt5 separately. If this is the case you may skip this step. If not, execute the following steps to install PyQt5.
     - Open *Anaconda Prompt* as administrator 
       - Right click Anaconda Prompt and select **Run as Administrator >** **Yes**
     - Enter the command
       ```sh
       conda install -c anaconda PyQt5
       ```
     - If prompt enter “**y**” to proceed with the installation
2. Installing [Pyserial](https://pythonhosted.org/pyserial/index.html) (we use version 3.4)
   - Open *Anaconda Prompt* as administrator 
     - Right click Anaconda Prompt and select **Run as Administrator >** **Yes**
   - Enter the command
     ```sh
     conda install -c anaconda pyserial
     ```
   - If prompted enter “**y**” to proceed with the installation
3. Download the Pump Program Files from GitHub
   - Navigate to the GitHub page [here](https://github.com/ClarkLabUCB/HarvardPumps_Python3)
   - Click the green button that says **Code** and select **Download ZIP**
   - Download and extract the file and move it into your documents or destination of choice.

## Usage

### Running the Scripts

Python code (.py files) will not be executable from Windows File Explorer unless you add Python to the PATH. This can be a tricky process, and we will not go into it. Instead, it is best to either execute the program from the *Anaconda Prompt*, by creating a Windows batch file (.bat), or by creating a standalone app with *pyinstaller*. The batch file and *pysinstaller* approach will be outlined in the [Alternative Execution Methods](#alternative-execution-methods) section. 

* To run from the *Anaconda Prompt*
  * Open *Anaconda Prompt*
  * Navigate to your current folder run the harvard_pump_control3.py code (example)
    ```sh
    cd C:\User\YourUserName\Documents\HarvardPumpProgram3
    python harvard_pump_control3.py
    ```
### Setting up the Pumps

#### Setting the COM port Number

The pumps need to be tethered together with ethernet cables which will eventually terminate into a COM port in the computer. Determine what COM port your pumps are connected to the computer with by opening the *Device Manager* on Windows. When you are positive of the COM port number that your devices are connected to the computer with, you will need to open both the pump_control3.py script and then set_pump_number3.py script and change the COM port number to that number. For example if your COM port number is **COM1**, then the line of code in the scripts that sets the COM port number should look like this: 
   ```sh
   serial_port = 'COM1'
   ```
#### Setting Individual Pump Addresses
    
It is common in many applications to tether pumps together; the pumps need to be sequentially assigned a unique address. Details for this process can be found in the Harvard Apparatus Milliliter Flow M.P.C Modular Pump Component User’s Manual which we have uploaded for your convenience [here](https://github.com/ClarkLabUCB/HarvardPumps_Python3/blob/main/702219%2C%202226%20Milliliter%20Manual.pdf). It can be found under Appendix E: Optional – Daisy-Chaining on page 21. 

It is probably most helpful to label to the pumps 0,1,2,3,4... and so on. 

### Using the Pump GUI

An overview of the Pump GUI is shown below.

![example pump image](/pump_control_gui.png)

For every pump tethered into the system., a line appears with the assigned pump number, a drop down menu to select for a 1 mL, 3 mL, 5 mL, 10 mL, 20 mL, or 30 mL Becton Dickinson syringe, an editable field to name the contents of the pump, an editable field to input a nominal (positive or negative integer) flowrate, its nominal current flow rate, the units of the current flow rate, and a **Prime** button, which will set the flow rate of that pump to 10,000 uL/hour. If the pump has a positive flow rate (out of the syringe), the flow will be shown as positive, if the pump has a negative flow rate (into the syringe), the flow will be shown as negative. At the top of the GUI are the **Run/Update** button and the **Stop** button. **Run/Update** will set the the flow rates of the connected pumps to the user-sepecified flowrates, **Stop** will set the flow rates of all pumps to 0. **IMPORTANT** In order to change the syringe size you need to **Stop** all pumps, then change the syringe size and then press **Run/Update** again. You **CANNOT** simply change the syringe size/units and press **Run/Update**. 

#### Assign Pump Syringe Size
The software is calibrated to run the user-input flow rates at six different Becton Dickinson (BD) syringe sizes: 1 mL, 3 mL, 5 mL, 10 mL, 20 mL, or 30 mL. The default syringe size is 1 mL. To change the the syringe size for any given pump, first press **Stop**. **WARNING**: It is extremeley important to press stop and stop all pumps before changing syringe size; if you change syringe size will the pumps are running, the software will **NOT** recognize the change in syringe size and assume the flow rate is still based on the assigned syringe size when the pumps were first started. After you have pressed **Stop**, you can click the **Syringe** size drop-down menu and select the correct syringe size. The syringe size for any given pump will remain the same until **Stop** is pressed again or the program is closed. 

#### Assign Pump Content Names
Assign pump content names by clicking the edit field next pump and entering the name of the pump content (e.g. oil, buffer, etc.). This name will remain the same until re-edited or the program is closed.

#### Assign the Flow Rate
All flow rates will be in uL/hour. To set the flow rate of a pump, click the edit field under "flow rate" for any given pump and enter your desired flow rate in uL/hour. The flow rate for the pump will not change until you click **Run/Update**. The current set flow rate of any given pump can be seen under the "Current flow rate" column. 

#### Priming Pumps
Pressing the **Prime** button for any pump will immediately set the flow rate of that pump to 10,000 uL/hr and start the pump. Essentially, it is equal to typing in 10,000 into the "Flow rate" column and then pressing **Run/Update**. To stop priming a pump, press **Stop**, which will stop all pumps. 

## Alternative Execution Methods

### Create a Batch File to Run a Python Script

A batch file is a file that will execute execute whatever script is written within it in the Windows command prompt. This can be used to create a file that will run the code necessary to launch the python script for the pump program. 

1. Locate the address of the activate.bat that activates the anaconda directory. This should be in the Scripts folder within the Anaconda3 folder on your computer. You may need to click view, then check “Hidden Items” in the Show/hide tab. An example location of this is: 
   ```sh
   C:\Users\YourUserName\anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```
	Or
   ```sh
   C:\ProgramData\Anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat
   ```
2. Locate the address of the folder that the pump control execution .py file **pump_control3.py** is located
3. Open the *Notepad* app on Windows
4. On the first line **call** the Anaconda activate.bat file, on the second line, use the command **cd** and to change the directory to the folder address, and on the third line run the pump control program with python pump_control3.py. An example looks like this:
   ```sh
   call C:\Users\YourUserName\anaconda3\Scripts\activate.bat
   cd C:\User\YourUserName\Documents\PumpProgram3
   Python pump_control3.py
   ```
 5. When you have written those three lines, and those three lines only. Select **File > Save As**
 6. In the **Save** menu select **Save as Type > ALL Files**
 7. Name your batch file whatever you want, like Run_pump_control.bat, as long as it ends in ".bat"
    - **Note:** It is the .bat extension that will save this file as a Windows Batch file that will run those commands in the windows prompt. The first line changes the windows prompt to the anaconda prompt, the second line changes the directory to your pump program folder location, and the last line runs the pump program.

Double clicking this .bat file from any location should run the commands and open the pump program. You can now just leave this .bat on the desktop for you to click whenever you want to run the pump control program.

### Create an Executable Program on your Machine with Pyinstaller
If you have found that these programs work with your pumps and are connected to your COM port of choice, then feel free to create an executable program of the pump program on your machine by following these steps:
1. Install [Pyinstaller](https://www.pyinstaller.org/#) (we used version 3.6)
2. Open *Anaconda Prompt* as administrator as outlined above
   - Enter the command
     ```sh
     conda install -c pyinstaller
     ```
   - If prompted enter “**y**” to proceed with the installation
3. Reopen *Anaconda Prompt* as administrator
4. Navigate to the current directory of the pump programs (both harvard3.py and harvard_pump_control3.py must be in this folder) with the **cd** command. An example looks like this:
  ```sh
  cd C:\User\YourUserName\Documents\HarvardPumpProgram3
  ```
5. Execute the following line of code to create an executable Windows application (.exe file) for the pump program
  ```sh
  pyinstaller harvard_pump_control3.py
  ```
  
This will create a bundle in a subfolder named **dist**, which will contain the executable application named pump_control3.exe. This app can then be used to run pumps on any computer without the need of Python or any of the packages. **Please be warned that you will need to use the same COM port that you used in the code when you created the app with pyinstaller.**
